<h4>Goal of this game</h4>
The goal of Glider Ball 3D is simple, yet challenging: Knock the ball into your opponent's goal! <br>
Think 'Rocket League' car-soccer gameplay, but instead of playing on boring, flat levels, the futuristic Gliders battle it out on interesting curve-shaped courses (more courses coming soon!).  And instead of having normal Earth-type gravity, Glider Ball 3D features Anti-Gravity, allowing the Gliders and ball to follow and hug the course surface wherever it leads, even if that means going upside down!
